# Real-USD-ILS-Exchange-Rate-Intelligence
This project is a high-reliability Fintech dashboard designed to track the USD/ILS exchange rate. Unlike simple trackers, this system uses a multi-source API architecture (including the **Bank of Israel**) and implements a **Moving Average Crossover (7/14)** trading strategy.
